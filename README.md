# Bezlik Year Calendar Planner

[Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) script for creating year planners on one page A1 paper format.

Script is based on [Year-Calendar-Script-for-Scribus](https://github.com/RaffertyR/Year-Calendar-Script-for-Scribus),
so the code is quite messy after I've removed a lot of interactive stuff, I didn't needed here.  It was created for [Bezlik Foundation](https://bezlik.org). 

### Requirements

* Scribus
* [Lato Font](https://www.latofonts.com/pl/lato-free-fonts/) installed

I've tested that on Manjaro Linux. No idea if it'll work on Windows or OSX.

### Usage

1. Download repository (or clone it) to local computer.
2. Run *Scribus*.
3. Click on menu Scripts->Run script, browse to *BezlikYearCalendar.py*.
4. Customize parameters (margins etc.).
5. Generate, and enjoy!
