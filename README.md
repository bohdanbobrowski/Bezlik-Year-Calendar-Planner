# Bezlik Year Calendar Planner

[Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) script for creating year planners on one page A1 paper format. Script is based on [Year-Calendar-Script-for-Scribus](https://github.com/RaffertyR/Year-Calendar-Script-for-Scribus),
so the code is quite messy after I've removed a lot of interactive stuff, I didn't needed here.

Script was created for [Bezlik Foundation](https://bezlik.org).
